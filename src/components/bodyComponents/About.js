            <p>I'm a one of those Software Developers who loves what they do. I'm passionate about web standards and
                keep abreast of new developments in industry. I always look for opportunities to improve my skills. I
                like to show off what I'm working on and also learn from others, which my strong communication skills
                help me do. I have keen attention to detail and value the design of a product as much as I value the
                code. I'm aware of the latest techniques but also know the limitations that developing for a broad
                audience can bring - actually, I embrace the challenge!</p>
